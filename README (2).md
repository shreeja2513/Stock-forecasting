 <!-- In this project I have written a python program that will predict the closing price of the given index for the next 2 days, given the information of 50 past days. 
I have written the code in the predict func() which takes pandas dataframe as input and returns a python list with two values (closing prices). I've used the provided dataset to train and test the model. -->
